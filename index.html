  <p class="lead">Decoding, Reranking, Evaluation, and Alignment for Machine Translation</p>
</div>

<p>DREAMT consists of code and data for students studying the
   basic algorithms behind statistical machine translation, 
   the technology that drives popular web services like
   <a href="http://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a>,
   <a href="http://microsofttranslator.com">Bing Translator</a>,
   and 
   <a href="http://freetranslation.com">FreeTranslation.com</a>.
</p>

<p>The best way to really understand how these algorithms work is to
   implement them yourself and see how they behave on real data.
   DREAMT provides you with data, simple baseline algorithms, and
   code to check the accuracy of your solution. You can run the baseline straight out of the box
   and try simple experiments within minutes. Then, to test your knowledge
   of <a href="http://www.statmt.org/book">textbook algorithms</a>, you 
   can implement them and see how they improve on our baselines. The 
   textbook algorithms only require a few dozen lines of code at most, and
   you'll understand them much better once you derive and implement them
   yourself.
</p>

<p>But the sky's the limit! Machine translation is hardly a solved problem.
   Can you do better than the textbook algorithms? Test out your NLP 
   hacking skills and see how accurately you can solve these four challenges:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="challenge1.html">The Alignment challenge</a>: given some translated sentences, identify the
      word-to-word translations within them.
  <li><a href="challenge2.html">The Decoding challenge</a>: given a statistical translation model and 
      some foreign sentences, return the most probable English translations.</li>
  <li><a href="challenge3.html">The Evaluation challenge</a>: given the output of several translation 
      systems, rank them by their accuracy.</li>
  <li><a href="challenge4.html">The Reranking challenge</a>: given a set of possible English translations 
      of a foreign sentence, choose the best one.</li>
</ol>
