{"name":"DREAMT","tagline":"Decoding, Reranking, Evaluation, and Alignment for Machine Translation","body":"### About DREAMT\r\n\r\nDREAMT consists of data and baselines for four open-ended, independent challenge problems designed for students learning about machine translation.\r\n\r\n1. The Alignment challenge: given a sentence-aligned text, produce word alignments.\r\n2. The Decoding challenge: given a translation model and some sentences, produce translations.\r\n3. The Reranking challenge: choose the best translation of a sentence from a list.\r\n4. The Evaluation challenge: given the output of several translation systems, rank them by accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Using DREAMT\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the design and use of DREAMT, read our paper, [Learning to Translate with Products of Novices](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez/papers/tacl2013-mt-class.pdf), which will be published in the [Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics](http://www.transacl.org/). \r\n\r\nDREAMT is distributed under an MIT license, which means you're free to do whatever you want with it. If you use DREAMT in published academic work, please cite the above paper.\r\n\r\nDREAMT has already been used in these courses.\r\n1. The [spring 2012 machine translation class](http://mt-class.org/) at Johns Hopkins University.\r\n2. The [2012 machine translation marathon](http://www.statmt.org/mtm12/), a week-long hackathon and summer school held annually in Europe.\r\n3. The [spring 2013 machine translation class](http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/sp2013-11731/) at Carnegie Mellon University.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nEmail Adam Lopez (<alopez@cs.jhu.edu>) with questions or comments.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
