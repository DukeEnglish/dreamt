  <h1>About DREAMT</h1>
</div>
<p>We wrote DREAMT as a teaching aid for our 
   <a href="http://mt-class.org">graduate class in machine translation</a>
   at Johns Hopkins University. To learn more about why we wrote it and
   how we use it, you can:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read <a href="http://www.transacl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/paper165.pdf">the paper</a> that we published in the  
    <a href="http://www.transacl.org/">Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics</a> (TACL) in 2013.
  </li>
  <li>Watch <a href="http://webcasterms1.isi.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=ea55185170054e13972a0ea5b932eb6c1d">the talk</a> 
    that Adam Lopez gave about DREAMT in the Information Sciences Institute's artificial intelligence seminar. 
    You can also browse <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez/talks/mt-class-isi.pdf">the talk slides</a>.
