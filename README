Welcome to DREAMT:
Decoding, Reranking, Evaluation, and Alignment for Machine Translation

DREAMT will consist of four baseline components.
1) The ALIGNER takes parallel texts and produces word alignments.
2) The DECODER takes source sentences and produce output translations.
3) The RERANKER takes output translations and produces a new ranking of them.
4) The EVALUATOR takes output translations and scores them against references.

At the moment, the only thing that's here is the aligner.
