  <h1>Alignment <font color="lightgrey">: Challenge Problem 1</font></h1>
</div>

<p>Aligning words is a key task in data-driven machine translation. We start with
   a large <b>parallel corpus</b> where the translation of each sentence
   is known. So the input consists of sentence pairs like this one:
</p>

<center>
<p><i>le droit de permis passe donc de $ 25 à $ 500 . &mdash;
we see the licence fee going up from $ 25 to $ 500 .</i></p>
</center>

<p>It is relatively easy to obtain data in this form, though not completely trivial. 
This particular example is from the Canadian Hansards, proceedings of government
meetings that are required to be published in both English and French.
To align the sentences
we can exploit document boundaries and structural cues arising from the fact that the 
documents are translations of each other, such as the fact that translated sentences will be 
in the same order, of similar length, and so forth. The problem is that we
don't know the word-to-word correspondences in each sentence. That's where you come
in: <b>your challenge is to write a program that aligns the words automatically</b>. For the
sentence above, you might output the following correspondences:
</p>

<p>
  <center>
    <i>le &mdash; the</i>, 
    <i>droit &mdash; fee</i>, 
    <i>permis&mdash; license</i>, 
    <i>passe&mdash;going</i>,
    <i>passe&mdash;up</i>,
    <i>donc&mdash;from</i>,
    <i>$ &mdash; $</i>,
    <i>25 &mdash; 25</i>,
    <i>à &mdash; to</i>,
    <i>$ &mdash; $</i>,
    <i>50 &mdash; 50</i>
  </center>
</p>

<p>
Some words might be unaligned (e.g. <i>we</i> and <i>see</i>), while some words 
might be aligned to multiple words in the corresponding sentence (e.g. <i>passe</i>
is aligned to <i>going up</i>). Sometimes words aren't exact translations of each
other. That's ok: even experienced bilinguals will sometimes disagree on the best
alignment of a sentence.
But while word alignment doesn't capture every nuance, it is very useful for 
learning translation models or bilingual dictionaries.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Run this command:</p>

<p><pre>git clone https://github.com/alopez/dreamt.git</pre></p>

<p>We have provided you with a very simple aligner written in Python
and around two million words of the Canadian Hansards.  
The source code of the aligner is contained in file called <tt>align</tt>
under the directory <tt>aligner</tt>.
The baseline algorithm works in two phases. First, we train models.  
The aligner observes the training sentences and then gives a score, between 
0 and 1, to each possible alignment. The baseline aligner simply 
computes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice's_coefficient">Dice's coefficient</a> 
between pairs of English and foreign words.  
It then aligns all pairs of words with a score over 0.5.
Run the baseline heuristic model 1,000 sentences
using the command:
</p>

<pre>align -n 1000 &gt; dice.a</pre>

<p>This runs the aligner and stores the output in <tt>dice.a</tt>. To view and
score the alignments, run this command:
</p>

<pre>grade &lt; dice.a</pre>

<p>This command scores the alignment quality by comparing the output alignments
against a set of human alignment annotations using a metric called the 
<b>alignment error rate</b>, which balances precision and recall of the
guessed alignments (<a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/P/P00/P00-1056.pdf">paper</a>). Look at 
the terrible output of this heuristic model -- it's better than chance, but 
not any good. Try training on 10,000 sentences instead of 1,000, by specifying 
the change on the command line:</p>

<pre>align -n 10000 | grade</pre>

<p>Performance should improve, but only slightly!  Another experiment that 
you can do is change the threshold criterion used 
by the aligner.  How does this affect alignment error rate?</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>Your task for this assignment is to <b>improve the
alignment error rate as much as possible</b>. It shouldn't be hard to 
improve it at least some: you've probably noticed that thresholding a Dice 
coefficient is a bad idea because alignments don't compete against one 
another. A good way to correct this is with a probabilistic model like IBM Model 1.
It forces all of the English words in a sentence to compete 
as the explanation for each foreign word.
</p>

<p>Formally, IBM Model 1 is a probabilistic model that generates each word of 
the foreign sentence \( {\bf f} \) independently, conditioned on some word 
in the English sentence \( {\bf e} \).  
The likelihood of a particular alignment \( {\bf a} \) of the foreign sentence therefore 
factors across words: 
\( P({\bf f}, {\bf a} | {\bf e}) = \prod_i P(a_i = j | |{\bf e}|) \times P(f_i | e_j) \).  
In Model 1, we fix \( P(a_i = j | |e|) \) to be uniform 
(i.e. equal to \( \frac{1}{|{\bf e}|} \)), so the likelihood 
only depends upon the conditional word translation parameters \( P(f | e) \).
</p>

<p>The iterative EM update for this model is straightforward. For every 
pair of an English word type
\( e \) and a French word type \( f \), you count up the expected 
(fractional) number of times tokens \(f\) are aligned to tokens of
 \(e\) and normalize over values of \(e\). That will give you a new
estimate of the translation probabilities \(P (f |e)\), which leads 
to new alignment posteriors, and so on. We recommend developing on a small 
data set (1000 sentenes) and only 
a few iterations of EM.  When you are finished, you should see some 
improvements in your alignments.</p>

<p>Developing a Model 1 aligner should be enough to beat our baseline system. 
But alignment isn't a solved problem, and the goal of
this assignment isn't for you to simply implement a well-known algorithm. You
can definitely do better than Model 1, but to do so you'll need to experiment.
Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul class="real">
  <li>Implement an HMM aligner
    <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/C/C96/C96-2141.pdf">(paper)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Add a sparse prior to word alignment probabilities and learn the model using Bayesian inference
    <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P11/P11-2032.pdf">(paper)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Train a French-English model and an English-French model, then 
    combine their predictions in some way 
    <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/N/N06/N06-1014.pdf">(paper)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Train a supervised discriminative feature-based aligner using the annotated development set.
    <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/P/P06/P06-1009.pdf">(paper)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Train an unsupervised feature-based aligner using the annotated development set.
    <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/P/P11/P11-1042.pdf">(paper)</a>.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=word+alignment">Seek out
    additional inspiration</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But the sky's the limit! Alignment isn't a solved problem, and you 
   should experiment to see how well you can do. Who knows? Maybe you'll
   develop the next state-of-the-art alignment algorithm!
